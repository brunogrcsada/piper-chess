## :heavy_exclamation_mark: Prerequisites

This project requires npm to execute the files, so ensure that it is installed.

### 1. Ensure node and npm are installed by running the following commands in your terminal:

```sh
node -v
```

```sh
npm -v
```

If they are not installed, follow the steps on [npm Docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

### 2. To run end-to-end tests, please install 'serve' globally in your machine:

```sh
npm install -g serve
```

If you are getting some errors after using that command and you are on Linux/MacOS, try running it as a superuser (sudo)

### 3. You will also need Cargo, the package manager for Rust. It's a pretty neat tool!

#### The following command will work on Linux and macOS systems:

```sh
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

#### If you are using Windows, please click on the following link to download rustup:

[https://win.rustup.rs](https://win.rustup.rs)

#### Further documentation:

[https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html)

### 4. Afterwards, clone this repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/brunogrcsada/piper-chess
```

Now, you should have everything that you need to proceed! Navigate into the folder you just cloned to find the code :)

## :book: Getting Started

### Docker

You can run a single docker image for the back and frontend with the following commands:

```sh
docker build -t piper .
docker run -p 2020:2020 -p 3001:3001 piper
```

### 0. Before trying out any of the other commands:

```sh
npm install
```

### 1. Starting the Rust Actix web server:

#### For the purposes of this exercise, the server code is stored in the 'server' folder

```sh
cd server
cargo run
```

### 2. In the project directory, you can run:

```sh
npm start
```

Runs the app in the development mode. :point_up_2: \
Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.

### 3. To run any tests written for the backend, run the following command:

```sh
cargo test
```

### 3. To run logic and UI tests for the app, run the following command:

```sh
npm test
```

```sh
a
```

This launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. :point_up_2: \
Clicking on the 'a' key runs all tests (excluding End-to-End tests).
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### 3. To view full tests and code coverage for the code:

```sh
npm test -- --coverage --watchAll=false
```

### 4. To run the E2E tests:

#### Note that the following command might be different depending on your Operating System:

```sh
npm run build
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. :point_up_2: \
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

```sh
cd server
cargo start
```

```sh
PORT=4221 serve -s build & npm run test:e2e
```

## üóíÔ∏è Coding Practices:

### Code cleanliness and documentation

Commenting code is a standard programming practice and mechanism to enhance comprehensibility whilst enabling developers to clarify the code in their own words. To ensure that my code is understood by another developer, I commented any unclear processes and included extra information behind my thought process. React helped me to compartmentalise functionality in different components, such as creating a separate timer widget that dealt with the general game countdown. Here is an example of where I applied both documentation practices and OOP to improve the readability and extensibility of the component:

### Code refactoring

Another fundamental element relating to development is the process of refactoring code. This describes the process of refining and improving pre-written code in such a way that does not alter its external function whilst mitigating the introduction of bugs. Refactoring enables written code to be more concise, improving its readability. One of the most thought-provoking parts of this project was handling states, possible moves and in-game highlight helpers for each piece in the game. It was initially becoming tedious to create selection statements for every possible move type and piece, such as the one seen below:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54673205/208888629-e9a9eb1d-42ff-463f-9ab7-7d451ab6a321.png)

To get around this problem in the frontend, I created a map of all pieces and a 'rule book' attached to each. The possible move ranges are all defined in one exported variable which can be used accross the project. After making this change and ensuring that all rules were looped and accessed directly from the map, it was a lot cleaner to make extra changes to edge-cases and piece-specific behaviour. For the pawn, since it requires quite a bit of logic depending on enemies surrounding the piece and its position, I implemented the behaviour in the screenshot above to handle the piece separately. However, this didn't impact the information obtained and used from the rule book.

## Project Management

To ensure that all tasks for the fullstack game were completed on time, I planned out all required core components for both the React and Rust codebases, and placed them as cards in Trello. Whilst I was quite ambitious to implement web sockets with Actix, there were a lot of initial issues with setting it up from scratch in Rust; unfortunately, the deadline for the project has set as a future plan for the game.
